2..........Data Science requires a lot of mathematical concepts understanding, such as:

Calculus, linear algebra, trigonometry, etc.
Probabilities and distributions
Then, you’ll obviously need to know about machine learning, including:

Inference, regression, clustering, tests
Time Series, Survival Analysis
CART, Random Forests, Map/Reduce, Feature selection
Models comparison
Neural networks, Deep learning
Computer vision, natural language processing, geolocation handling
Obviously, to be able to apply this knowledge, you need to be able to master IT Tools, such as:

Programming (R, Python, SAS, Java, whichever)
Software (SPSS, Spark, etc.)
Since you’ll be wrangling with data so much, you need to be able to feel comfortable with:

Databases (SQL and NOSQL)
Web languages and web semantics to extract data from websites
Data visualization
And finally, there are other non-obvious skills you’ll need to be a Data Scientist:

Communication and presentation (you are a specialist, and will most probably need to explain your findings to non-technicians to get them to adopt your recommandations)
Law an ethics, as it would be too easy, with the whole set of tools and technical assets that a data scientis has, to pursue wrong actions or even illegal activities, so it is important to know some boundaries
IT architecture, IT security, Cloud Computing. This is not of direct responsibility for a data scientist, but a good one should be smart enough not to take risks, and to take advantage of the best resources around him/her.
Project management, etc
